# Predicting Player Fatigue & Injury Risk for Footballers

The aim of the project is to develop a **predictive dashboard** that forecasts **player fatigue and injury risk** based on match and player data. This will provide **coaches and medical staff** with actionable insights to **optimize player rotation, manage workload, and prevent injuries**. The dashboard will help **football clubs** make informed decisions to enhance player performance, reduce injury risks, and maintain a **healthy squad throughout a congested football season**.

## üìÇ Data Sources
The datasets used in this project were sourced from multiple locations:
- **Premier League All Players Stats 23/24** (from Kaggle) - Main dataset containing season-long statistics.
- **Player Overview Dataset** - Includes additional player attributes such as height.
- **Player Stats Dataset** - Provides more detailed statistics such as tackles, passing accuracy, and aerial duels.

These datasets are also referenced in the **References** section.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run the Code
The code for this project was developed and executed using **Google Colab**, a cloud-based platform that allows running Python code without requiring a local setup.

### **Steps to Run the Code:**
1. **Open Google Colab**  
   - Visit **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** and sign in with your Google account.
   
2. **Upload the Dataset Files**  
   - Upload the required dataset files:  
     - `premier-player-23-24.csv`  
     - `player_stats.xlsx`  
     - `player_overview.xlsx`  

3. **Upload the Python Script**  
   - Upload `untitled7.py` to Colab or copy its contents into a new Colab notebook.

4. **Run the Code Cells**  
   - Execute each cell **sequentially** to **preprocess the data, integrate datasets, and perform necessary transformations**.

5. **Check Outputs**  
   - The outputs include:
     - **Cleaned datasets**
     - **Performance stats integration**
     - **Preprocessing steps necessary for model training**
