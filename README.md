Predicting Player Fatigue & Injury Risk for Footballers

The aim of the project is to develop a predictive dashboard that forecasts player fatigue and injury risk based on match and player data, providing coaches and medical staff with actionable insights to optimize player rotation, manage workload, and prevent injuries. The dashboard will support clubs in making informed decisions to optimize player performance, reduce injury risks, and maintain a healthy squad throughout a congested football season!



## Data Sources
The datasets used in this project were sourced from multiple locations:
- Premier League All Players Stats 23/24** (from Kaggle) - Main dataset containing season-long statistics.
- Player Overview Dataset** - Includes additional player attributes such as height.
- Player Stats Dataset** - Provides more detailed statistics such as tackles, passing accuracy, and aerial duels.




The code for this project was developed and executed using Google Colab, a cloud-based platform that allows running Python code without requiring a local setup.
Steps to Run the Code:
Open Google Colab:
visit Google Colab and sign in with your Google account.
Upload the Dataset Files:
Upload the required dataset files (premier-player-23-24.csv, player_stats.xlsx, player_overview.xlsx) into the Colab environment. These datasets are also referenced in the References section.
Upload the Python Script:
Upload untitled7.py to Colab or copy its contents into a new Colab notebook.
Run the Code Cells:
Execute each cell sequentially to preprocess the data, integrate datasets, and perform necessary transformations.
Check Outputs:
The outputs include cleaned datasets, performance stats integration, and preprocessing steps necessary for model training.
Dependencies Used:
pandas (for data manipulation)
numpy (for numerical operations)
matplotlib & seaborn (for visualization)
sklearn (for machine learning models, if applicable)
